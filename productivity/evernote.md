# Evernote

#### Navigating Notes and Notebooks 

Instead of navigating via the sidebar, I set the sidebar to hidden and instead use Switch To \(Cmd+J\) to navigate around notes and notebooks.

* Helps me save real estate on my screen 
* Keyboard navigation is faster than mouse navigation
* I don't have to be overwhelmed by my notebook hierarchy all the time.
